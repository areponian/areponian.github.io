Proprietary Software Is Often Hostile to Users
----------------------------------------------

Proprietary software—also called nonfree software—is software that the user
is forbidden to study, modify, or share. These restrictions are not
accidental; they are deliberate mechanisms of control. When a developer
withholds the source code, the user is placed in a position of dependence,
unable to verify what the program truly does.

This imbalance of power is the root of the problem. When one party controls
the software and the other merely "uses" it, the user becomes vulnerable to
abuse. And in practice, this abuse is widespread.

Proprietary programs frequently include malicious functionalities:
    • surveillance and data harvesting
    • digital restrictions (DRM)
    • remote kill switches
    • forced updates
    • advertising and behavioral tracking
    • device lock‑in and vendor‑controlled ecosystems

These behaviors are not rare exceptions—they are the business model.
When the user cannot inspect or modify the software, the developer is free
to prioritize profit over the user's autonomy, privacy, or safety.

Power invites misuse. Once a developer has the unilateral ability to change
the software on your device, the temptation to exploit that power becomes
strong. Whether the motive is profit, analytics, or control, the result is
the same: the user is mistreated.

Online services amplify this problem. Although a service is not "software"
in the traditional sense, it can still impose the same injustices:
    • opaque server‑side code
    • data retention without consent
    • algorithmic manipulation
    • dependency on proprietary clients

Many services require the user to run a proprietary app merely to access
them. These apps often contain the same harmful features as traditional
proprietary programs, and sometimes more.

Mobile devices introduce yet another layer of surveillance. Even when the
software is free, the underlying radio systems track location as a matter
of design. Proprietary mobile operating systems add additional tracking,
analytics, and restrictions on top of that.

As of 2026, the number of documented cases of proprietary software engaging
in harmful behavior is enormous—and growing. The pattern is clear:
when users lack control, developers exploit that lack of control.

If you encounter a proprietary program or service that mistreats users,
we encourage you to document it and share your findings publicly. Only by
exposing these practices can we help others understand the risks.

Freedom in computing is not a luxury. It is a requirement for a healthy,
trustworthy digital society. Software should serve its users—not the other
way around.
