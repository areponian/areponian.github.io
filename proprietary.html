    <h1>Proprietary Software Is Often Hostile to Users</h1>

    <h2>Why Proprietary Software Is Often Hostile to Users</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>
      Proprietary software—also called nonfree software—is software that the user
      is forbidden to study, modify, or share. These restrictions are not
      accidental; they are deliberate mechanisms of control. When a developer
      withholds the source code, the user is placed in a position of dependence,
      unable to verify what the program truly does.
    </p>

    <p>
      This imbalance of power is the root of the problem. When one party controls
      the software and the other merely “uses” it, the user becomes vulnerable to
      abuse. And in practice, this abuse is widespread.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Malicious Behaviors in Proprietary Software</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>surveillance and data harvesting</li>
      <li>digital restrictions (DRM)</li>
      <li>remote kill switches</li>
      <li>forced updates</li>
      <li>advertising and behavioral tracking</li>
      <li>device lock‑in and vendor‑controlled ecosystems</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These behaviors are not rare exceptions—they are the business model.
      When the user cannot inspect or modify the software, the developer is free
      to prioritize profit over the user's autonomy, privacy, or safety.
    </p>

    <p>
      Power invites misuse. Once a developer has the unilateral ability to change
      the software on your device, the temptation to exploit that power becomes
      strong. Whether the motive is profit, analytics, or control, the result is
      the same: the user is mistreated.
    </p>

    <h3>Online Services Amplify the Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Although a service is not “software” in the traditional sense, it can still
      impose the same injustices:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>opaque server‑side code</li>
      <li>data retention without consent</li>
      <li>algorithmic manipulation</li>
      <li>dependency on proprietary clients</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Many services require the user to run a proprietary app merely to access
      them. These apps often contain the same harmful features as traditional
      proprietary programs, and sometimes more.
    </p>

    <h3>Mobile Devices: A Perfect Surveillance Platform</h3>
    <p>
      Mobile devices introduce yet another layer of surveillance. Even when the
      software is free, the underlying radio systems track location as a matter
      of design. Proprietary mobile operating systems add additional tracking,
      analytics, and restrictions on top of that.
    </p>

    <h3>Predators in Free Software</h3>
    <p>
      Turning free software into proprietary software, especially for a fee,
      is seen as predatory in the free software community, as many people rely on it.
      They wake up one day and then find out it’s proprietary and costs “$4.99” (i.e.).
    </p>

    <p>
      As of 2026, the number of documented cases of proprietary software engaging
      in harmful behavior is enormous—and growing. The pattern is clear:
      when users lack control, developers exploit that lack of control.
    </p>

    <h3>What You Can Do</h3>
    <p>
      If you encounter a proprietary program or service that mistreats users,
      we encourage you to document it and share your findings publicly. Only by
      exposing these practices can we help others understand the risks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Freedom in computing is not a luxury. It is a requirement for a healthy,
      trustworthy digital society. Software should serve its users—not the other
      way around.
